# scla-unsubscribe

This is a project to unsubscribe all UTSA students from the SCLA mailing list.

The SCLA is one of those membership organizations that email you throughout the semester to join their honor society. Except, it's not a real honor society - it's just a money grab to make you feel special while providing no real value.

This project entails a somewhat advanced Go 'script' to login to UTSA, scrape every single email address, and then unsubscribe them from the SCLA mailing list.
